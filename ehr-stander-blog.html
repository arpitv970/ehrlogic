										Electronic health records (EHRs) have become an essential component of
										healthcare delivery in recent years. EHRs allow healthcare providers to access
										and share patient information in real-time, enabling more efficient and
										coordinated care. However, interoperability between different EHR systems
										remains a significant challenge, hindering the ability of providers to exchange
										patient data across different organizations.
									</span>
									<p></p>
									<aside>
										<p>One of the key solutions to promoting interoperability and data sharing is
											the establishment of EHR standards. EHR standards are a set of guidelines
											and protocols that ensure that EHR systems can communicate with each other
											seamlessly, without any loss or alteration of data. These standards help to
											ensure that EHRs are interoperable, meaning that healthcare providers can
											exchange data regardless of the EHR system they use.
										</p>
									</aside>
									<aside>
										<div class="row blog_flax">
											<div class="col-md-8">
												<p>There are several benefits to implementing EHR standards. First and
													foremost, EHR standards promote patient safety by ensuring that
													providers have access to complete and accurate patient information.
													This information can be critical in emergency situations, where
													quick access to accurate data can make all the difference. EHR
													standards also promote data privacy and security by ensuring that
													patient data is transmitted and stored securely</p>
												<p>Another important benefit of EHR standards is that they promote
													efficiency and cost savings in the healthcare system. By ensuring
													that EHR systems can communicate with each other, providers can
													avoid duplicative tests and procedures, reducing the overall cost of
													care. Additionally, EHR standards can help to reduce administrative
													burden by streamlining workflows and reducing the need for manual
													data entry</p>

											</div>
										</div>

									</aside>
									<aside>
										<p>Despite the benefits of EHR standards, adoption has been slow. One reason for
											this is the lack of a unified approach to EHR standards, with different
											standards being used in different regions and by different organizations.
											This lack of consistency makes it difficult for EHR systems to communicate
											with each other, leading to interoperability challenges.</p>
									</aside>
									<aside>
										<p>To address these challenges, efforts are underway to develop a universal set
											of EHR standards that can be adopted by healthcare providers worldwide. The
											Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)
											has developed a set of standards, including the Fast Healthcare
											Interoperability Resources (FHIR) standard, which is rapidly gaining
											traction in the healthcare industry</p>
